busy student looking for convenient meal ideas, [Meal Planner Name] helps you plan 
efficient nutritious meals with ease.


Story:

Our idea came from a shared struggle as college freshmen, meal planning. During our conversations, we noticed that:
- We found it hard to constantly come up with things to make based available ingredients and time.
- We had friends with allergies who constantly had to double-check ingredients.
- We had limited cooking tools in dorms.
- Most meal-planning apps were either too complicated, too generic, or didn’t let us upload our own recipes.
- And despite wanting to cook, we wasted a lot of time flipping through random recipe sites, only to give up and order food.


So we thought, what if we make a meal planning website specifically for college students. One that contains:

- Custom user profiles, where people can save allergies and preferred cooking methods.
- Recipe objects that store ingredients, allergens, cooking time, and method.
- A way to upload, save, and favorite recipes, since students often make their own meals or remix existing ones.
- Sorting tools so users can filter by cooking time, allergens, equipment, or ingredients available.
